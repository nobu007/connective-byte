# Health Check Module - Goals

## Module Purpose

The Health Check module provides comprehensive health monitoring capabilities for the ConnectiveByte backend application. It enables real-time monitoring of application health through extensible health checks.

## Primary Objectives

1. **Real-time Health Monitoring**: Provide instant visibility into application health status
2. **Extensibility**: Allow easy addition of custom health checks (database, external APIs, etc.)
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor response times for each health check
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Detect and report partial failures without crashing

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Response Time**: Health check endpoint responds in < 100ms for basic checks
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for health check endpoint
- **Extensibility**: New health checks can be added in < 5 lines of code
- **Coverage**: All critical system components have health checks

## Success Criteria

- [x] Basic health check endpoint functional
- [x] Extensible architecture for adding custom checks
- [x] Automatic error handling and recovery
- [x] Consistent response formatting
- [x] Detailed health check results with timing
- [x] Memory usage monitoring
- [x] Uptime tracking
- [ ] Database connectivity check (when database is added)
- [ ] External API health checks (when external services are added)

## Business Value

- **Operational Excellence**: Enables proactive monitoring and alerting
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified debugging with detailed health information
- **Production Readiness**: Meets enterprise health check requirements
- **Scalability**: Health checks can be integrated with orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker)
