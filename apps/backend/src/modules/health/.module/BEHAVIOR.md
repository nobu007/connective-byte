# Health Check Module - Expected Behavior

## Input Specifications

### HTTP Request
```http
GET /api/health HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3001
```

**Parameters:** None
**Headers:** None required
**Body:** None

## Processing Flow

### 1. Request Reception
- HealthController receives HTTP GET request
- No authentication required (public endpoint)
- No input validation needed

### 2. Health Check Execution
```
HealthService.getHealthStatus() is called
  ↓
Execute all registered health checks in parallel:
  - checkUptime()
  - checkMemory()
  - [any custom checks]
  ↓
Aggregate results:
  - Collect all check results
  - Calculate response times
  - Determine overall status
  ↓
Return ServiceResult<HealthStatus>
```

### 3. Response Formatting
- Controller formats result as ApiResponse
- Maps health status to HTTP status code:
  - `status: 'ok'` → HTTP 200 OK
  - `status: 'error'` → HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
- Returns JSON response

## Output Specifications

### Successful Response (HTTP 200)

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "status": "ok",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-15T12:34:56.789Z",
    "uptime": 123.45,
    "checks": [
      {
        "name": "uptime",
        "status": "ok",
        "message": "Application running for 123.45 seconds",
        "responseTime": 1
      },
      {
        "name": "memory",
        "status": "ok",
        "message": "Heap: 45.23MB / 128.00MB (35.3%)",
        "responseTime": 2
      }
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

### Degraded Response (HTTP 503)

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "status": "error",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-15T12:34:56.789Z",
    "uptime": 123.45,
    "checks": [
      {
        "name": "uptime",
        "status": "ok",
        "message": "Application running for 123.45 seconds",
        "responseTime": 1
      },
      {
        "name": "memory",
        "status": "error",
        "message": "Heap: 120.00MB / 128.00MB (93.8%)",
        "responseTime": 2
      }
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

### Error Response (HTTP 500)

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Failed to retrieve health status",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

## Behavioral Rules

### 1. Overall Status Determination
- **OK**: All health checks return `status: 'ok'`
- **ERROR**: At least one health check returns `status: 'error'`

### 2. Check Execution
- All checks execute in parallel (non-blocking)
- Individual check failures don't prevent other checks
- Each check has timeout protection (via BaseService)
- Response time is measured for each check

### 3. Error Handling
- Service errors are caught and logged
- Failed checks return error status with message
- Controller always returns valid JSON (never crashes)
- Errors in production mode hide stack traces

### 4. Performance Requirements
- Total health check execution time: < 100ms (target)
- Individual check timeout: 5 seconds (default from BaseService)
- Parallel execution ensures checks don't block each other

### 5. Extensibility Behavior
- New checks can be registered at any time
- Checks can be dynamically added/removed
- Registration is thread-safe (Map operations)
- Check functions must be async and return HealthCheck

## Edge Cases

### No Checks Registered
**Behavior:** Returns OK status with empty checks array
**Reason:** System can be healthy even without specific checks

### All Checks Fail
**Behavior:** Returns HTTP 503 with all check errors
**Reason:** System is unhealthy and should not receive traffic

### Partial Failure
**Behavior:** Returns HTTP 503 (conservative approach)
**Reason:** Even one critical failure indicates system issues

### Slow Check
**Behavior:** Check continues but doesn't block other checks
**Reason:** Parallel execution prevents cascading delays

### Check Throws Exception
**Behavior:** Caught, logged, returned as error check result
**Reason:** One bad check shouldn't crash the entire health endpoint

## State Management

### Module State
- **healthChecks Map**: Stores registered check functions
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent
- **No Caching**: Always executes checks on demand (future: add caching)

### Request Lifecycle
1. Request received
2. Execute checks (parallel)
3. Format response
4. Return response
5. No state persisted

## Integration Behavior

### With Load Balancers
- Health check endpoint can be polled frequently
- Returns 503 when unhealthy → load balancer removes instance
- Returns 200 when healthy → load balancer routes traffic

### With Monitoring Systems
- Prometheus can scrape health metrics
- CloudWatch can poll endpoint
- Response time tracking enables alerting

### With Docker/Kubernetes
- Can be used as liveness probe
- Can be used as readiness probe
- Non-zero exit on unhealthy status
