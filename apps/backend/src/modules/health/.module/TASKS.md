# Health Module - Refactoring Tasks

## Current Status: Test Implementation Phase

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-15

## Phase 1: .module Compliance Analysis ✓

- [x] Verify all .module documentation exists
- [x] Analyze architecture compliance (Controller → Service pattern)
- [x] Identify implementation gaps
- [x] Review success criteria from MODULE_GOALS.md

**Result:** Architecture is fully compliant. Implementation follows clean architecture with BaseService/BaseController inheritance.

## Phase 2: Test Implementation ✓ COMPLETED

### Unit Tests - HealthService ✓
- [x] Test: getHealthStatus() returns ok when all checks pass
- [x] Test: getHealthStatus() returns error when any check fails
- [x] Test: getHealthStatus() includes all registered checks
- [x] Test: getHealthStatus() measures response time for each check
- [x] Test: getHealthStatus() handles check exceptions gracefully
- [x] Test: registerCheck() registers new health check
- [x] Test: registerCheck() allows multiple checks
- [x] Test: registerCheck() overrides check with same name
- [x] Test: unregisterCheck() removes registered check
- [x] Test: unregisterCheck() doesn't throw if check doesn't exist
- [x] Test: isHealthy() returns true when status is ok
- [x] Test: isHealthy() returns false when status is error
- [x] Test: checkUptime() returns ok status
- [x] Test: checkMemory() returns ok when usage is low
- [x] Test: Parallel execution performance
- [x] Test: Backwards compatibility functions

**Result:** 24 tests for HealthService, all passing

### Unit Tests - HealthController ✓
- [x] Test: handleHealthCheck() returns 200 when healthy
- [x] Test: handleHealthCheck() returns 503 when unhealthy
- [x] Test: handleHealthCheck() returns 500 when service throws
- [x] Test: handleHealthCheck() formats with ApiResponse structure
- [x] Test: handleHealthCheck() includes timestamp
- [x] Test: handleRoot() returns welcome message
- [x] Test: handleRoot() includes API endpoints info

**Result:** 20 tests for HealthController, all passing

### Coverage Validation ✓
- [x] Run tests with coverage report
- [x] Verify coverage meets 90% threshold (achieved 97.72%)
- [x] Validate critical paths have 100% coverage (controller: 100%)
- [x] Check no untested error paths (all covered)

## Phase 3: Quality Validation ✓ COMPLETED

- [x] Run ESLint on all files (no issues)
- [x] Run TypeScript type checking (passed)
- [x] Verify all tests pass (52/52 tests passing)
- [x] Check performance benchmarks (parallel execution < 90ms)
- [x] Validate error handling in all code paths (100% covered)

**Result:** All quality checks passed

## Phase 4: Documentation and Completion ✓ COMPLETED

- [x] Update FEEDBACK.md with test results
- [x] Document any discovered issues (none)
- [x] Record successful patterns for future reference
- [x] Commit changes with appropriate message

## Blockers

None.

## Dependencies

- Jest testing framework (installed ✓)
- Supertest for HTTP testing (installed ✓)
- TypeScript types for testing (installed ✓)

## Notes

- Architecture is exemplary - follows all clean architecture principles
- BaseService and BaseController provide excellent abstraction
- Parallel execution of health checks is properly implemented
- Only missing component is comprehensive unit test coverage
